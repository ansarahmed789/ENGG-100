# Mechanical Can Crusher ðŸ¥«ðŸ”§  
ENGG100 Engineering Graphics and Design â€“ Group Project

## Overview  
This project involved designing and building a **mechanical can crusher** as part of the ENGG100: Engineering Graphics and Design course. The goal was to create an eco-friendly, manually operated device capable of crushing aluminum cans to reduce their volume and make recycling more efficient.

Our team explored multiple design concepts, evaluated them through a decision matrix based on cost, efficiency, safety, and manufacturability, and ultimately selected the most practical and effective design. The project emphasized mechanical design thinking, teamwork, and CAD modeling.

## Key Features  
- Manual operation using a pivot-based crushing handle  
- Simple assembly using basic mechanical components  
- Designed without electrical or hydraulic systems for simplicity  
- Reduces can size significantly for easier recycling  
- Optimized for safety, ease of use, and efficient performance

## Design Process  
1. **Initial Brainstorming**: Multiple design concepts were created with sketches.
2. **Evaluation Matrix**: Each design was rated based on key criteria including cost, part count, safety, and efficiency.
3. **Design 4** was selected as the final concept due to its balance between functionality and simplicity.
4. **CAD Modeling**: All parts were modeled individually and assembled in SolidWorks.
5. **Draft Files**: Generated for each component and the full assembly.

## Project Files  
- Drafts for all individual parts  
- Final exploded assembly draft  
- Evaluation matrix and design rationale

## What We Learned  
- The importance of early-stage planning and sketching  
- How to evaluate designs systematically using engineering criteria  
- Proficiency in CAD software for part design and assemblies  
- Working collaboratively as a team on an end-to-end engineering project

## Future Improvements  
- Add a locking mechanism for safer operation  
- Refine part tolerances for smoother assembly  
- Use stronger or lighter materials to improve durability and usability
